{"name":"Wavesim","body":"# Description\r\nThis is a physically correct simulation of waves on a surface, for example water-waves. It can also be used to simulate Microwaves, and has features like the support for different refraction indices, different wave sources and custom borders. Therefore, experiments like the double-slit-experiment can be easily simulated.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Physically correct wave simulation\r\n* Support of different refraction indices\r\n* Support of custom borders (e.g. double-slit)\r\n* Customisable visualisation colors\r\n","tagline":"A physically correct 2D Wave Simulation","google":"UA-31412457-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
