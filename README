This is a physically correct simulation of waves on a surface, for example water-waves. 
It can also be used to simulate Microwaves, and has features like the support for different 
refraction indices, different wave sources and custom borders. Therefore, experiments like 
the double-slit-experiment can be easily simulated.

Features:
  - Physically correct wave simulation
  - Support of different refraction indices
  - Support of custom borders (e.g. double-slit)
  - Customisable visualisation colors
